Why bother with art. Take away movies, music and poetry. Life suddenly isn't as fun, is it? I don't think we should constantly look for what will provide us with practical advantages, but also consider the interest factor. Reading a novel may not provide you with insight into the stock market, but it sure can be fun to read. Instead of only looking at Mars as this journey that could provide us with a bunch of technologies and potentially improve world peace, let's also consider how exciting it is. As humans venture into space, you can be sure that there will be lots of fiction books that follow - biographies of crazy adventures, and poems of the red landscape. We even have a pseudo-biographic film, The Martian, only this time it could be based on a true story (and hopefully involve less risk to the protagonists). This wave of entertainment fueled by exploration may motivate people to pursue passions that could enrich their lives (think of how many people grew an interest in STEM after seeing Sputnik). All of these new developments can keep the world interesting. All the “practical” benefits that come from Mars will sure be welcome, but I'm sure the entertainment that's inspired will be somewhat similar in significance. I stated in the abstract that I wouldn't dwell on the "desire to explore", but I think it could be a captivating journey, for those going to Mars and for those on Earth.
