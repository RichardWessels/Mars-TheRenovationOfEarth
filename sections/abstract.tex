When the British decided to colonize parts of America, do you think their main focus was the potential greatness of the future American people? I guess not. Their main focus was likely their potential profit in having a hand in the rich American land. This has been somewhat different in our discussions about the potential colonization of Mars. We often speak of the future Martian society, and how prosperous it could be. We also speak about man's innate desire to explore the edges of his reach. This all makes sense, but in the ears of a politician, it is usually ignored. This is not to insult politicians, however, their roles are usually to improve the lives of the people that elected them. Therefore, they usually focus on more concrete concepts, such as health care over our desire to explore. This article plans to give more focus on the potential benefit to Earth, rather than merely speak about Mars. Much of this article is speculation and doesn't contain much data. It is written to further discussions, not to receive praise from statisticians. This article also focuses on Mars, but this is not to disregard other potential bodies, such as Titan and Europa. Some topics deal specifically with Mars (such as deuterium mining), however, topics such as politics could apply to all. This is a look at how the colonization of other celestial bodies can improve life on Earth.
